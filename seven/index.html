Taking their cue from the insight that we live in post-exotic times in which many musical traditions prosper and proliferate in a way that ignores geographic, ethnic and ideological limitations and world orderings, the musical cosmopolitans of ensemble ɛkstʁaktə want to explore and examine the musical potential of traditions they know – as well as traditions alien to them." />

							DAY 1: Algorithms are thoughts
						</p>
						<br><br>
						<hr></hr>
						<br><br>
						<p>
							Exploring the logic processes behind 'p5.js', sharing some reflections around <a href = "https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/series/technologies-lived-abstraction" target = "_blank">'Technologies of Lived Abstraction'</a> and collaboration on the web. We will read relevant information about net.art, exploring forms of coding that can deviate, opening a space for relation and experience. We will explore hands-on how to setup a basic Processing sketch. We will start to explore the Object-Oriented programming approach of functions within functions and how it allows us to create our first traces of color and shapes through algorithms.

						<br><br>
						<p>
							Note: We explored the two essential functions of p5.js, which are <sub>function setup() {}</sub> and <sub>function draw(){}</sub>, we understood that setup works as a previous step, which only runs once and we also studied the <sub>function draw(){}</sub>, which can be understood as a loop, it is a function that does not stop running, so it involves time and in that sense it is related to Julian Rohrhuber's perception of 'algorithms as formulas that exist to unfold, in the form of a process, in time and over time, and depends on its past inputs' (2018). Later we explore how to use variables and how to pass these parameters from the variables to our functions, in addition we study the basic functions to draw 2D objects and to move them, with the function <sub>translate()</sub> / also we explore <sub>rotate()</sub>, accompanied by <sub>millis()</sub>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Later on we focus on the use of a variable we called <sub>var counter = 1;</sub> which within the <sub>function draw(){}</sub> we used to control the growth of a shape, through the addition of a pixel every second, we reflect on thinking time in pixels and we explored around with <sub>'counter++;</sub> or <sub>counter += 0.5;</sub>
						</p>
						<p>
							Following this curiosity to control changes in time we explore the creation of conditionals to control changes in time and to make our counter variable stop, then we create a function like the one below:
							<br><br><sub>
							if (counter >= height) {
							<br>
							counter = 1;
							<br>
							}</sub>
						</p>
						<p>
							Later we explored the <sub>noise()</sub> function, which is a type of gradient noise created by the mathematician <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise" target = "_blank">Ken Perlin</a>. Exploring Perlin noise we created explorations where noise controlled the size and the position in x, and y for diverse 2D shapes / finally we had an introduction to 3D objects in p5.js through the WEBGL class, an API implemented in JavaScript for rendering 3D graphics within any web browser.
